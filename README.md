# Project Object 
* Implement dynamic IR drop prediction using U_NET

# Accomplished 
* I was able to my own dataset for neural net training
* Complete feature extraction from my dataset
* Was able to run the inital model training
* Model couldn't perform as expected.

# Citation 
* Original research paper I wanted to impelement :https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10597
* model architecture and feature extraction mainly taken from : https://github.com/circuitnet/CircuitNet/tree/main
