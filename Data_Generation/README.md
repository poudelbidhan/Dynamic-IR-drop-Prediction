# Automated Synthesis and Place & Route (PnR) Flow for ML Data Generation

This project provides a set of scripts to automate a significant portion of the digital ASIC backend flow, specifically designed for **generating diverse datasets suitable for machine learning applications** . The flow starts from RTL source code, proceeds through synthesis using **Cadence Genus**, and performs Place & Route (PnR) using **Cadence Innovus**, culminating in post-route analysis results.

## Overview

The workflow is divided into two main stages, orchestrated by Bash scripts, with the overarching goal of generating varied design metrics and physical layouts for ML training:

1.  **Synthesis Stage (`run_synthesis.sh` + `synthesis_flow.tcl`):**
    *   Takes RTL Verilog code for multiple base designs as input.
    *   Runs synthesis using **Cadence Genus** for each design across a specified range of target clock periods (frequencies), introducing initial design variations.
    *   Generates synthesized gate-level Verilog netlists (`.v`) and corresponding timing constraints (`.sdc`) for each design/period combination.
    *   Produces basic synthesis reports (timing, area, power, QoR).
    *   Outputs are organized into a structured directory (`synthesis/outputs/work/`).

2.  **Place & Route Stage (`run_variations.sh` + `pnr_flow.tcl` + modules):**
    *   Takes the synthesized netlists and SDC files produced by the Synthesis Stage as input.
    *   Runs the PnR flow using **Cadence Innovus**.
    *   Iterates through multiple PnR parameter variations for each synthesized design to create diverse physical implementations:
        *   Target Core Utilization (`UTILIZATION_FACTORS`)
        *   Power Distribution Network (PDN) configuration (`PDN_SETTINGS`)
        *   Optional Decoupling Capacitor insertion (`DECAP_OPTIONS`)
    *   Performs standard PnR steps: Initialization, Floorplanning, PDN Generation (including power pad file creation), Placement, Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), Optional Decap Insertion, and Routing.
    *   Includes Power Grid View (PGV) library generation and subsequent dynamic Power/IR Drop analysis, testing multiple power pad configurations to generate varied power grid performance data.
    *   Generates final PnR database (`.inn`), DEF files, final netlists, PnR logs, and detailed analysis reports (IR drop, timing, power, area metrics) â€“ crucial data points for ML datasets. Outputs are organized by variation (`pnr_modular/`).

This combined flow systematically generates a rich dataset capturing the relationship between design characteristics (RTL, timing constraints), PnR parameters, and resulting physical implementation metrics (area, timing, power, routability, IR drop).

## Features

*   **ML Data Generation Focused:** Designed to efficiently generate diverse data points by varying synthesis and PnR parameters.

## Customization

*   **Designs/Parameters:** Modify the arrays and `case` statements in the `.sh` scripts to add/remove designs, change clock periods, or alter PnR variations to enrich the dataset.
*   **Flow Steps:** Edit the individual `.tcl` scripts to adjust tool options, change strategies (e.g., different placement effort, CTS targets), or add commands to extract specific metrics/reports needed for ML features. Update `run_pnr_flow.tcl` if the PnR sequence changes significantly.
*   **MMMC:** Enhance `mmmc.tcl` for multi-corner/multi-mode PnR optimization if needed to add more dimensions to the data.

## Notes

*   **Placeholders:** Remember to replace placeholder paths in `run_variations.sh` with actual paths to your technology files.
*   **Technology Tuning:** PnR parameters within the Tcl scripts (PDN dimensions, layers, placement/routing options) likely require tuning for your specific PDK and design goals, which itself can be a source of variation for data generation.
*   **Error Handling:** The scripts include basic error checking. Detailed debugging often requires inspecting the tool's log files (Genus logs, Innovus `pnr_flow_*.log`). Robustness might be needed for large-scale data generation.
